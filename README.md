## Road Obstacle Recognition Using Images And Machine Learning

This repository contains a thesis which aims to detect objects in image data using machine learning technics. The network that is used for the object detection is SqueezeDet, a convolutional neural network based object detector described in : https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01051. The original repository is here : https://github.com/BichenWuUCB/squeezeDet


Instructions for downloading and running the code can be found in the original repository.


The differences between this repository and the original include the following changes:

- Python3 instead of Python2


- Changed paths and sythax in order to work on Windows OS


- IDE instead of terminal for executing ( Any Python3-capable IDE can be used )


- Changed Tensorflow's saver class so that it creates the checkpoint paths correct for Windows OS
